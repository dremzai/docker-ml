# Docker images for Deep Learning

This repository aims at delivering trouble-free docker images for people
wanting to try out deep learning frameworks.

See the respective README files to learn how to start and use them.

`docker-nvidia` is the base image, providing an install of cuda 7.5 on centos7,
with CUDNN4 and common tools for compiling a framework.
