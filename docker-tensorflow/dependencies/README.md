# Tensorflow dependencies

This image provides all the necessary dependencies for building TensorFlow

However, the build itself cannot be run on DockerHub, so you are encouraged to
build it yourself.

From [https://github.com/nitnelave/docker-ml/tree/master/docker-tensorflow](The
TensorFlow folder on GitHub), run `docker built -t nitnelave/tensorflow .`.
